According to the police, on Saturday, at about 09:30, the body of Mohamed Abdulla, aged 40 years old, was found lying in an open field in Bramlin Markman Road in Malabar, Port Elizabeth. “Abdulla sustained a gunshot wound to his face, and his body was discovered by a pedestrian using the field as a shortcut,” said police spokesperson, Colonel Priscilla Naidu. She added that the deceased was abducted earlier in the morning from his house in Shauderville by the three suspects. “The house where he was renting was also set alight and completely gutted, and police have opened a case of murder, abduction and arson,” said Colonel Naidu. Again on Saturday, at about 11:40, it is alleged that the same suspects went to a house in Lawler Street in Shauderville and fatally wounded Deon Matheyse, aged 41 years-old. It is alleged that the victim and two friends were sitting in a shack, at the back of the house, when the suspects approached “They were assaulted and Matheyse was shot in his stomach and the other two victims managed to escape,” said Colonel Naidu.
