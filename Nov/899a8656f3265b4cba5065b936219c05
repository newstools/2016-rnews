 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Eastern Cape says it welcomes the SAPS' recruitment of police reservists that is now taking place in the Eastern Cape. An advertisement was placed in papers on Thursday calling for people to join the police reservists. "I appeal to members of the public to come forward and volunteer. Let’s join hands to make our communities safer," said Bobby Stevenson, the DA Eastern Cape's Shadow MEC for Safety and Security.. "This step is long overdue. The DA believes that fighting crime is a partnership between the community and the police. The SAPS alone can never win the war against crime. We need more boots on the ground and greater community participation is part of the solution." Stevenson said that in January this year, the MEC for Safety and Liaison, Wiziwe Tikana, dismissed the DA’s call in the media for such a recruitment drive. "She had stated in a reply to a legislature question I asked, that there were 1 739 reservists in 2014/15 and 2 031 in 2015/16," he added. "The DA believes in a safe province which means we need high visibility policing, good detective work and crime intelligence so criminals can be nailed and jailed. "I will be asking follow-up questions to the MEC about the implementation and outcome of this recruitment drive." Stevenson said that the DA wants to see streets of the province safe for children to play in, women to walk in and businesses to operate in. "An enhanced climate of safety and security is a prerequisite for investment and creating jobs."
