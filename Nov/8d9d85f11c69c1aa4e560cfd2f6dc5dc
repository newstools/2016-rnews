 Uitenhage police swiftly arrested three suspects, aged between 18 and 21 years old, after they robbed a spaza shop in Lower Drosdy Street, Uitenhage, on Wednesday evening. It is alleged that three suspects, one armed with a firearm and the other two with knives, entered the shop at about 5:20pm and demanded money from the tills. “A scuffle ensued leading to the owner being stabbed in the chest. Thereafter, all the men fled the scene on foot,” described police spokesperson, Captain Gerda Swart. She added that it was when nearby residents heard the commotion at the shop andd went to investigate that they saw the three men running away. “They notified the police and the immediate surroundings were cordoned off and searched. While the search was on, one of the police officials spotted one of the suspects and he was arrested while attempting to evade arrest,” she added. However, Uitenhage detectives worked throughout the night leading to the arrest of the other two suspects at different hideouts. “The remaining two suspects were arrested at different houses at about 2am and 5am on Thursday morning,” Captain Swart said. Police recovered one of the cellphones stolen during the robbery. She added that the shop owner, who is now a state witness in the case and cannot be identified, was admitted to hospital where he is in a “critical but stable” condition. The three suspects are due to appear in the Uitenhage Magistrate’s Court on Monday facing charges of business robbery and attempted murder. Uitenhage Station Commander Brigadier Laurence Soekoe said that the arrests come as successes of high visibility policing, which is aimed at reducing and combatting of crime in the area - especially as the festive season approaches.
