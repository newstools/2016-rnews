 British Airways (operated by Comair) launched its prepaid booking facility, enabling customers to choose their preferred seat on any of their flights within southern Africa. Shaun Pozyn, Head of Marketing for British Airways (operated by Comair) says this enhancement will allow customers the choice of purchasing their preferred seat at the time of booking their flight on ba.com.  For customers wanting to purchase prepaid seating and who have already booked their flights, they can do so by using the “Manage My Booking” functionality via ba.com. “For a nominal fee customers can select their preferred seat, whether it’s an aisle, window or middle seat, as well as the ability to sit closer to the front, ensuring that they are one of the first customers to disembark. This is especially useful for business travellers needing to get to meetings, for example.” The cost for prepaid seating varies, depending on the route being booked: seats on routes shorter than 90mins are priced from R64, while routes longer than 90 mins are priced between R80 to R144. Customers who choose to not purchase prepaid seating, will have their seats allocated as per the existing process. The new pre-paid booking is live for all customers travelling on British Airways within southern Africa. To take advantage of this new capability visit ba.com.
