 "The Municipality's Ethics and Anti-Corruption Hotline has now gone live. Our commitment to the people of this Metro is to stop corruption in its tracks and this Hotline speaks to that promise,” Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor Athol Trollip said at a press conference on Thursday. While corruption in political leadership stopped on Election Day 2016, there is still a legacy of corruption in some existing contracts and possibly even syndicated criminality, all of which we are going to stop. This new administration has already launched numerous investigations into these alleged corrupt contracts and is now intensifying the battle against corruption by launching this much-needed hotline. This facility provides municipal employees and residents with a channel to report all forms of corruption, fraud, maladministration and unethical behaviour. KPMG will collate all received information and forward this onto the Municipality, but will protect the personal information of whistleblowers in the interest of transparency. This creates an independent and arms-length relationship between the Municipality and all complainants. "I urge all municipal employees and residents with information to make use of this hotline so that we can root out what remains of the legacy of corruption and unethical behaviour left behind by our predecessors,” said Mayor Trollip. KPMG will manage and operate the hotline on behalf of the municipality, which can be accessed by dialling 0800 007 086 or by sending and email to [email protected]// <![CDATA[ !function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}() // ]]>.
