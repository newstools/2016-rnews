 Update:Â IT WAS NOT JUST IN NELSON MANDELA BAY: DA ACCUSES ANC OF SEVERAL COORDINATED DISRUPTIONS  The African National Congress (ANC) in the Nelson Mandela Bay said that it will hold a media briefing on Friday morning to address residents on how two councillors in the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality ended up in hospital and shots fired inside the Feather Market Centre during Thursday's highly-charged council meeting. According to the ANC on its Facebook Page, the briefing will happen at 11am at its Florence Matomela House offices, in Govan Mbeki, Port Elizabeth. Reports suggest that trouble began when the opposition ANC objected to an item on the municipality's confidential green paper. In the end, glass water jugs were allegedly thrown at Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip, the Speaker and Councillors. Unfortunately, Democratic Alliance (DA) Portfolio Councillor for Roads and Transport, Rayno Kayser, was injured and had to be taken to hospital with a deep cut to the head. An ANC female Councillor is also reported to have collapsed in the chaos and was also ferried to hospital. Port Elizabeth police had to be called in to restore order. It is alleged that it was a security guard, who actually fired two warning shots while trying to control the fighting Councillors. Exact details of the fracas are still not clear. Councillors from both parties had to be escoted out of the meeting by police, who had cordoned off Military Road.
